# EDA-gym
This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project provides a deep dive into gym user data. Our goal is to paint a clear picture of gym usage patterns, user demographics, and how trends evolve.

- **Why is this important?** By understanding these elements, gyms can make data-driven decisions to optimize services, tailor marketing efforts, and enhance the overall member experience.

Our approach involves:
- **Comprehensive Data Cleaning**: Meticulously handling missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
- **In-depth Statistical Analysis**: Employing statistical methods to summarize and interpret key data characteristics.
- **Rich Visualizations**: Utilizing a variety of charts—including histograms, bar plots, pie charts, boxplots, and heatmaps—to visually explore data relationships and trends.
- **Pattern and Trend Identification**: Specifically focusing on subscription patterns, visit frequencies, workout preferences, and the influence of seasonal changes on gym attendance.
